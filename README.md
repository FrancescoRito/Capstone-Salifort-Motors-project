# Capstone-Salifort-Motors-projec
Capstone Project for Google Advanced Data Analytics

## Project Overview

This project analyzes employee survey data from Salifort Motors to identify factors influencing employee retention and develop a predictive model for employee churn.  The goal is to provide insights to the senior leadership team to improve retention strategies.

## Business Case

Salifort Motors, a leading alternative energy vehicle manufacturer, conducted an employee survey.  The analysis of this data aims to understand why employees leave the company and predict future churn.

## Approach

This project utilizes a [Regression Model/Tree-based Machine Learning Model - *scegli uno*] to predict employee churn based on factors such as department, number of projects, average monthly hours, and other relevant data points.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this analysis (`data/employee_survey_data.csv`) contains employee survey responses, including [elenca le variabili pi√π importanti].

## Methodology

The analysis was performed using [linguaggio e librerie principali, es. Python con Pandas, Scikit-learn].  The following steps were taken:

1.  Data Cleaning and Preprocessing (`scripts/data_processing.py` or within the notebook)
2.  Feature Engineering (if applicable)
3.  Model Training (`scripts/model_training.py` or within the notebook)
4.  Model Evaluation
5.  Visualization and Interpretation (`notebooks/employee_retention_analysis.ipynb`)

## Results

[Riassumi brevemente i risultati principali.  Ad esempio: "The model achieved an accuracy of X% in predicting employee churn. Key factors influencing churn include..."]  Include immagini o grafici rilevanti nella cartella `images/` e fai riferimento ad essi qui.

## Model

The trained model is saved as `models/trained_model.pkl`.

## How to Run the Code

1.  Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/salifort-employee-retention.git`
2.  Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3.  Run the analysis notebook: `jupyter notebook notebooks/employee_retention_analysis.ipynb` (oppure esegui gli script direttamente)
